### this is a terrible code now

#### TODO: `Xu Sun @ 05/08/2018`

- [ ] rewrite likelihood.cxx/h with new mRICH configuration
> read in gemc simulation results and generate photon hit distribution for each PID
>
> save photon hit distribution into histogram

- [ ] update event class to a ROOT class
- [ ] update track class to a ROOT class
- [ ] add a new ROOT class for log likelihood calculation
> generate an ROOT tree to store likelihood to be a pion, Kaon and proton
- [ ] update LLTreeDst class to a ROOT class
- [ ] re-write Makefile to generate ROOT shared library
- [ ] add macros to analysis likelihood
